\textit{Energy management within private household has seen significant progress in recent years due to the advancement in technology, increasing integration of solar energy generation and adoption of Electric Vehicles(EVs) operating bidirectionally to exchange power. This creates opportunities for a household to participate in energy market by utilizing local and mobile energy assets. This research and development undertaking explores a case of energy management within household by utilizing Reinforcement Learning(RL) methods to learn strategies to minimize net energy exchange cost to the grid.}

\textit{With the use of several RL algorithms and rule based heuristic, this work compares performance of different learned strategies and demonstrates that the agent learns to optimize the objective of cost reduction by a significant margin compared to rule based strategies.}
